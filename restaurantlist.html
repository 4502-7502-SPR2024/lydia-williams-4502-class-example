  <h1>8 Best BBQ Restaurants in Memphis, TN</h1>
  <p>As someone who grew up in Memphis, I have a lot of love for good BBQ. Here is my personal list of eight of the best places to go to get authentic, Memphis style BBQ.</p>

  <main>
    <section>
      <ul>

        <div class="list-item">
          <h2>1.Charlie Vergos' Rendezvous</h2>
          <p>Back in the 1940s, Charlie Vergos took a few racks of ribs, rubbed them down with a spice blend borrowed from his father's Greek chili recipe, and cooked them hot and fast over charcoal in a pit fashioned from an old coal chute. The Rendezvous has been the revered home of Memphis-style dry-rubbed ribs ever since.</p>
          <p>52 S. 2nd St. 
            Memphis, TN
            38103
            (901) 523-2746
          </p>
          <a href="https://hogsfly.com/">Link</a>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="list-item">
          <h2>2.A&R Bar-B-Que</h2>
          <p>The chopped-pork sandwich at A&R is a wonder. The first bite explodes with flavor, the tender meat merging into the warm, soft bun with cool, crisp pops of slaw. The rib sandwich is even better—a short, meaty slab, wedged (bones and all) between two slices of plain white bread with lots of slaw and A&R's signature sauce.</p>
          <p>1802 Elvis Presley Blvd
            Memphis, TN 
            38106
            (901) 774-7444
          </p>
          <a href="https://aandrbbq.com/">Link</a>
        </div>
      </div>


     <div class="list-item">
          <h2>3.The Bar-B-Q Shop</h2>
          <p>Visit the home of barbecue spaghetti, Memphis' unique contribution to Southern barbecue sides. The Vernon family still uses the recipe created by Brady Vincent, the restaurant's original owner. It's the ideal accompaniment for a platter of succulent half-and-half ribs, which are dry-rubbed on one end and mopped with sauce on the other, a delicious compromise uniting the city's competing wet and dry styles.</p>
          <p>1782 Madison Ave.
            Memphis, TN 
            38104
            (901) 227-1277
          </p>
          <a href="https://thebar-b-qshop.com/">Link</a>
        </div>
      </div>


         <div class="list-item">
          <h2>4.Central BBQ</h2>
          <p>With pulled pork, brisket, chicken, turkey, sausage, and even smoked portobello mushrooms, Central BBQ can please the fussiest of crowds. It now has four locations around the city—from the original Midtown joint on Central Avenue, which gave the restaurant its name, to a newer spot downtown.</p>
          <p>6201 Poplar Ave.
            Memphis, TN
            38119
            (901) 417-7962
          </p>
          <a href="https://eatcbq.com/">Link</a>

      </div>

         <div class="list-item">
          <h2>5.Jim Neely's Interstate Bar-B-Que</h2>
          <p>Jim Neely founded this place back in 1979, and it has been one of the city's top smoked-rib destinations ever since. (Their chopped-pork sandwiches are notable too.) Pro tip for air travelers: If you miss the original Third Street location, grab a sandwich at the Memphis International Airport. There's an Interstate Barbecue next to Gate C7.</p>
          <p>2265 S. 3rd St. 
            Memphis, TN
            38190
            (901) 775-2304

        <div class="list-item">
          <h2>6.Germantown Commissary</h2>
          <p>Head to the Memphis suburbs to Germantown Commissary, a favorite among locals and celebrities alike, that was once a general store. Each plate, from pulled pork to smoked chicken to brisket, is served with a deviled egg and classic sides like slaw and beans. The Commissary is also renowned for their barbecue nachos, a signature app since they first opened in 1981.</p>
          <p>2290 S. Germantown Rd. 
            Germantown, TN 
            38138 
            (901) 754-5540

<div class="list-item">
          <h2>7.One&Only BBQ</h2>
          <p>One & Only BBQ was founded in Memphis in 2011. Since then, it has grown to be one of the most highly rated bbq restaurants in all of Memphis. They are widely known for their twice baked potato and banana pudding.</p>

          <h2>8.Tops Bar-B-Q</h2>
          <p>Whether it is the perfect pork sandwich, scrumptious ribs, or the best burger or brisket, TOPS has you covered. And of course, no meal from TOPS would be complete without the sides, whether you have a taste for beans, slaw, potato salad, fries or chips.</p>
